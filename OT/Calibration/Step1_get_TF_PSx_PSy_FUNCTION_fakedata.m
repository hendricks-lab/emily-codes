%%% This function calculates the power spectrum, FRF, and coherence,
%%% as well as the added functionality to cut out any part of the photodiode 
%%% signal that shows abrupt and persistant change (likely from sudden stage
%%% movement when using the joystick during drift correction, for
%%% example).

%%% NOTICE HERE THAT the mean sumQUAD signal in volts output is an
%%% APPROXIMATION because the sum signal channel length does not get
%%% updated as compared to the xQUAD and xAOD channel (hmmmm I think I 
%%% changed this... -Ora 04/2021). Similarily, the power spectrum graph is 
%%% also directly from the raw signal, and thus is from a slighlty larger 
%%% sample than the FRF (when cutting is enabled). This should not matter 
%%% as the corner frequency should not be affected.

%%% Original code name: Step1_TF_Loic_2018b_FUNCTION

%Ora's Changes:
%10.2020 - Commented out a bunch of figures because they were annoying (10/2020)
%03/2021 - I'm pretty sure I added the correction to the sum signal (kpd) so that
%          it's consistent with the x & y signals. Note - here, what is called x
%          corresponds to what is shown as y in labview (same direction as laser
%          oscillation). Similarly, what is called y is shown as x in labiew
%          (perpendicular to laser oscillation).
%03.2021 - Added calculation of y-direction power spectrum (perpendicular to trap)
